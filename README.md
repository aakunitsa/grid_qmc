# grid_qmc

Grid-based stochastic and deterministic electronic structure methods.

# TODO list (deterministic):
1. Poisson solver
2. Grid-based Hartree-Fock method
3. Grid-based explicitly correlated MP2 in real space (Sinanoglu theory)

# TODO list (stochastic):
1. FCIQMC in real space using mixed grid-orbital representation
