# grid_qmc

Grid-based stochastic and deterministic electronic structure methods. The code is currently in the development stage.

# TODO list (deterministic):
1. Grid-based Hartree-Fock method
2. Grid-based explicitly correlated MP2 in real space (Sinanoglu theory)

# TODO list (stochastic):
1. Memory efficient FCIQMC in real space using mixed grid-orbital representation.
2. MPI parallelization.
